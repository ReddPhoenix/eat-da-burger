## **Project Link**
The app is deployed on Heroku: [Eat-Da-Burger](https://boiling-taiga-72789.herokuapp.com/index)
## **Description**

  ## **Demo**
  ![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReddPhoenix/eat-da-burger/main/public/assets/img/demo.gif)
 
 ## **Usage**
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not using either a local database or JAWSDB.
